# UnioCraft
UnioCraft is a Minecraft server that hit 1.2M unique players, 1200+ max concurrent players and stayed open for 6 years. As it's founder and only administrator, I managed it's players and staff, programmed it's games and website, advertised widely on social media and web. I met with Java and improved myself on programming journey with this project. I stopped working on this project because of several reasons. Most importanly I wanted to move on and work on some different projects.
